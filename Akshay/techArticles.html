                <h2>Laptops</h2>
                <p>A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a
                    screen and alphanumeric keyboard. These typically have a "clamshell" form factor, typically having
                    the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and the keyboard on the inside of
                    the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as
                    having a "laptop mode."</p>

                <h2>Mobiles</h2>
                <p>A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened
                    to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a
                    radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency
                    link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides
                    access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).</p>

                <h2>Personal Computers</h2>
                <p>A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it
                    feasible for individual use.[1] Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end
                    user, rather than by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large, costly minicomputers and
                    mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with personal computers.</p>

                <h2>Tablet</h2>
                <p>A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile
                    operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a
                    single, thin and flat package. Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but
                    lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have</p>

                <h2>ICs</h2>
                <p>An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a
                    microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor
                    material, usually silicon. Large numbers of tiny MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect
                    transistors) integrate into a small chip. This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude
                    smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components.</p>

                <h2>Super Computers</h2>
                <p>A supercomputer is a computer with great speed and memory. This kind of computer can do jobs faster
                    than any other computer of its generation. They are usually thousands of times faster than ordinary
                    personal computers made at that time. Supercomputers can do arithmetic jobs very fast, so they are
                    used for weather forecasting, code-breaking, genetic analysis and other jobs that need many
                    calculations.</p>
